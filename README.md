  * As a user I want to be able to view all stocks.
  * As a user I want to be able to add the stocks that I choose
    to my portfolio.
  * As a user I want to know what my total profit and losses are,
    for individual stocks and for the entire portfolio. 
    
To use, run `bundler` in terminal which will install all require gems. If you do not have bundler, you can get it [here](http://bundler.io/). 
In terminal, run `rails server` it will create a localhost. 

Access you localhost to see the project.
